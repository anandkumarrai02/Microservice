### Why Microservices?

Microservices is an architectural style where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific business function and operates on its own. These services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, making the system more modular and easier to manage.

#### Project Overview

- **Project Name**: 11 Microservice CI/CD Pipeline
- **Deployment Platform**: AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- **Application Type**: E-Commerce Website

 **[Here pease find the complete descriptive blog about the project!!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11RJl4sKeRVAhpk08oyN9sCYl639mfFyA/view?usp=sharing)**

## Microservices

1. Ad Sense Service
2. Cart Service
3. Checkout Service
4. Currency Service
5. Email Service
6. Frontend Service
7. External Frontend (for load balancing)
8. Payment Service
9. Product Catalogue Service
10. Recommendation Service

These microservices can be deployed on an EKS cluster, which provides a managed Kubernetes environment to run containerized applications. Each microservice runs in its own container, and Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of these containers.

## Benefits of Microservices

- **Scalability:** Independent scaling of services.
- **Resilience:** Service failures do not impact the entire system.
- **Development Speed:** Parallel development and quicker releases.
- **Technology Diversity:** Use of the best-suited technology for each service.
- **Isolation and Maintenance:** Easier to understand, develop, test, and maintain.

## Project Components and Pipeline

### CI/CD Pipeline Using Jenkins

- **Jenkinsfiles:** Define steps for building, testing, and deploying each service.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent environments.
- **AWS EKS:** Managed Kubernetes service for deployment.

### Hands-On Implementation Steps 

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**

1. **Create a User in AWS IAM**: Create a new user with any name.
2. **Attach Policies**: Attach the following policies to the newly created user:
   - AmazonEC2FullAccess
   - AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy
   - AmazonEKSClusterPolicy
   - AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy
   - AWSCloudFormationFullAccess
   - IAMFullAccess
3. **Create an Inline Policy**: Create an inline policy with the following content and attach it to your user:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "eks:*",
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
4. **Generate Secret Access Key**: Once the IAM user is created, generate its Secret Access Key and download the `credentials.csv` file.

**Launch Virtual Machine Using AWS EC2**

1. **EC2 Instance Requirements and Setup**:
   - **Instance Type**: `t2.large`
     - vCPUs: 2
     - Memory: 8 GB
     - Network Performance: Moderate
   - **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)
   - **Security Groups**: Security groups act as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
```
- Port 22 (SSH): Allows SSH access to the instance.
- Port 80 (HTTP): Allows web traffic to the instance.
- Port 465 (SMTP): Used for secure email transmission.
- Port 3000: Commonly used for development servers (e.g., Node.js).
- Port 8080: Often used for web servers and development.
- Port 8081: Another common port for web servers.
- Port 9090: Typically used for web-based management interfaces.
- Port 9000: Often used for custom applications.
- Port 32630: Specific to your application needs.
- Port 6443: Kubernetes API server.
- Port 9115: Prometheus metrics.

- Outbound Rules: Allow all traffic to ensure the instance can communicate externally.
```
2. **SSH into the Server**: After launching your virtual machine, Open your terminal and use the following command to SSH into your instance:

```sh
ssh -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns
```

Replace `/path/to/your-key-pair.pem` with the path to your key pair file and `your-ec2-public-dns` with the public DNS of your EC2 instance.

**Install AWS CLI, EKSCTL & KUBECTL on VM Server**

1. **AWS CLI**:
   ```sh
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   sudo apt install unzip
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```

2. **KUBECTL**:
   ```sh
   curl -o kubectl https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.19.6/2021-01-05/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
   chmod +x ./kubectl
   sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin
   kubectl version --short --client
   ```

3. **EKSCTL**:
   ```sh
   curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
   sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
   eksctl version
   ```

4. **Save All Scripts**: Save all the scripts in a file, for example, `ctl.sh`, and make it executable using:
   ```sh
   chmod +x ctl.sh
   ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   ```sh
   ./ctl.sh
   ```

#### AWS Configure Steps

To configure AWS CLI, use the following command:
```sh
aws configure
```
This command will prompt you to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, and output format. This setup allows the AWS CLI to interact with your AWS account.

### Installing Java, Jenkins, and Docker on Ubuntu

Execute these commands on the Jenkins server:

1. **Install OpenJDK 17 JRE Headless**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
   ```

2. **Download Jenkins GPG Key**:
   ```sh
   sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
   ```

3. **Add Jenkins Repository to Package Manager Sources**:
   ```sh
   echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
   ```

4. **Update Package Manager Repositories**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

5. **Install Jenkins**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install jenkins -y
   ```

Save this script in a file, for example, `install_jenkins.sh`, and make it executable using:
```sh
chmod +x install_jenkins.sh
```

Then, you can run the script using:
```sh
./install_jenkins.sh
```

This script will automate the installation process of OpenJDK 17 JRE Headless and Jenkins.

#### Install Docker

To install Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Package List**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

   ```

### Creating an EKS Cluster

To set up an EKS cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Create the EKS Cluster**:
   ```sh
   eksctl create cluster --name=EKS-2 --region=ap-south-1 --zones=ap-south-1a,ap-south-1b --without-nodegroup
   ```
   - **--name**: Specifies the name of the cluster.
   - **--region**: Defines the AWS region where the cluster will be created.
   - **--zones**: Lists the availability zones within the region.
   - **--without-nodegroup**: Creates the cluster without any node groups initially.

2. **Associate IAM OIDC Provider**:
   ```sh
   eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --region ap-south-1 --cluster EKS-2 --approve
   ```
   - This command associates an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider with your EKS cluster, which is necessary for IAM roles for service accounts.

3. **Create a Node Group**:
   ```sh
   eksctl create nodegroup --cluster=EKS-2 --region=ap-south-1 --name=node2 --node-type=t3.medium --nodes=3 --nodes-min=2 --nodes-max=4 --node-volume-size=20 --ssh-access --ssh-public-key=DevOps --managed --asg-access --external-dns-access --full-ecr-access --appmesh-access --alb-ingress-access

   - Click **Add webhook**.

After completing these steps, your Jenkins multi-branch pipeline will start building automatically.

### Phase 3: Continuous Deployment

Run these commands on the server to create a Service Account, Role, and Role Binding, and to generate a token for the Service Account. This setup will allow you to deploy your application on the main branch.

- Create a namespace for isolation:
  ```sh
  kubectl create namespace webapps
  ```
#### Service Account
  
A **Service Account** in Kubernetes is used to provide an identity for processes that run in a Pod. This identity allows the processes to interact with the Kubernetes API server. Service accounts are typically used for applications running within the cluster that need to communicate with the Kubernetes API.

1. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Create a file named `svc.yml` with the following content:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ServiceAccount
     metadata:
       name: jenkins
       namespace: webapps
     ```
   - Apply the configuration:
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f svc.yml
     ```

2. **Create a Role**:

#### Role

A **Role** in Kubernetes defines a set of permissions within a specific namespace. It specifies what actions can be performed on which resources. Roles are used to grant access to resources like Pods, Services, and ConfigMaps within a namespace.

   - Create a file named `role.yml` with the following content:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: Role
     metadata:
       name: app-role
       namespace: webapps
     rules:
     - apiGroups: ["", "apps", "autoscaling", "batch", "extensions", "policy", "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
       resources: ["pods", "componentstatuses", "configmaps", "daemonsets", "deployments", "events", "endpoints", "horizontalpodautoscalers", "ingress", "jobs", "limitranges", "namespaces", "nodes", "persistentvolumes", "persistentvolumeclaims", "resourcequotas", "replicasets", "replicationcontrollers", "serviceaccounts", "services"]
       verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
     ```
   - Apply the configuration:
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f role.yml
     ```

3. **Bind the Role to the Service Account**:

#### Role Binding

A **Role Binding** grants the permissions defined in a Role to a user or a set of users, including service accounts. It binds the Role to the Service Account, allowing the Service Account to perform the actions specified in the Role. 

   - Create a file named `bind.yml` with the following content:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: RoleBinding
     metadata:
       name: app-rolebinding
       namespace: webapps
     roleRef:
       apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
       kind: Role
       name: app-role
     subjects:
     - kind: ServiceAccount
       name: jenkins
       namespace: webapps
     ```
   - Apply the configuration:
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f bind.yml
     ```

### Creating a Secret Token for the Service Account

To create a secret token for the Service Account, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Secret**:
   - Create a file named `secret.yml` with the following content:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: jenkins-token
       namespace: webapps
     type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/service-account.name: "jenkins"
     ```
   - Apply the configuration:
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f secret.yml
     ```

2. **Retrieve the Token**:
   - Get the name of the secret created for the service account:
     ```sh
     kubectl get secrets -n webapps
     ```
   - Describe the secret to retrieve the token:
     ```sh
     kubectl describe secret <secret-name> -n webapps
     ```

Here, You will see the Service Account Token. Save the token for later use and This token can be used by Jenkins to authenticate with the Kubernetes API server.


### Configure Jenkins to use the secret token for authenticating with your Kubernetes cluster

#### Jenkins Configuration Steps

1. **Install the Kubernetes Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
   - In the **Available** tab, search for the **Kubernetes** plugin.
   - Install the plugin and restart Jenkins if required.

2. **Add the Token to Jenkins Credentials**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Credentials**.
   - Select the appropriate domain (e.g., Global).
   - Click **Add Credentials**.
   - Choose **Secret text** as the kind.
   - Enter the token in the **Secret** field and give it an **ID** (e.g., `k8-token`).
   - Kubernates Endpoint API - You can find it in your AWS EKS cluster. 
   - Cluster name- Provide any name. 
   - NameSpace â€“ webapps  

3. **Configure Kubernetes in Jenkins**:
   - Create a new Dummy Jenkins pipeline job for Generating Pipeline Script.
   
   - In the pipeline script, use the `withKubeCredentials` block to configure Kubernetes credentials:
     ```groovy
     withKubeCredentials(kubectlCredentials: [[
       caCertificate: '', 
       clusterName: 'EKS-2', 
       contextName: '', 
       credentialsId: 'k8-token', 
       namespace: 'webapps', 
       serverUrl: 'https://B7C7C20487B2624AAB0AD54DF1469566.yl4.ap-south-1.eks.amazonaws.com'
     ]]) { 
       // Your pipeline code here
     }
     ```

### Explanation of Server URL

The **serverURL** is the endpoint of your Kubernetes API server. This is the address Jenkins will use to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster. You can find this URL in your AWS EKS cluster details. Hereâ€™s how to get it:

1. **AWS Management Console**:
   - Go to the **EKS** section in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select your cluster.
   - In the **Cluster** details, you will find the **API server endpoint**. This is the URL you need.

2. **AWS CLI**:
   - You can also retrieve the server URL using the AWS CLI:
     ```sh
     aws eks describe-cluster --name <cluster-name> --query "cluster.endpoint" --output text
     ```
This setup ensures that Jenkins uses the specified token to authenticate with the Kubernetes API server securely. 

### Create A Jenkinfile on Main Branch

Hereâ€™s the Jenkinsfile with the provided script for deploying to Kubernetes and verifying the deployment. This file should be placed in the main branch, which is your deployment branch

```
pipeline { 
    agent any 
    stages { 
        stage('Deploy To Kubernetes') { 
            steps { 
                withKubeCredentials(kubectlCredentials: [[
                    caCertificate: '', 
                    clusterName: 'EKS-2', 
                    contextName: '', 
                    credentialsId: 'k8-token', 
                    namespace: 'webapps', 
                    serverUrl: 'https://B7C7C20487B2624AAB0AD54DF1469566.yl4.ap-south-1.eks.amazonaws.com'
                ]]) { 
                    sh "kubectl apply -f deployment-service.yml" 
                } 
            } 
        } 
        stage('Verify Deployment') { 
            steps { 
                withKubeCredentials(kubectlCredentials: [[
                    caCertificate: '', 
                    clusterName: 'EKS-2', 
                    contextName: '', 
                    credentialsId: 'k8-token', 
                    namespace: 'webapps', 
                    serverUrl: 'https://B7C7C20487B2624AAB0AD54DF1469566.yl4.ap-south-1.eks.amazonaws.com'
                ]]) { 
                    sh "kubectl get svc -n webapps" 
                } 
            } 
        } 
    } 
}

```

Once you commit this file to the main branch, your pipeline will automatically start the build and deployment process.

### Delete EKS Cluster 

To delete your EKS cluster and avoid any unnecessary billing, you can use the following command:

```sh
eksctl delete cluster --name EKS-2 --region ap-south-1
```

This command will delete the EKS cluster named `EKS-2` in the `ap-south-1` region. However, remember to also delete any associated resources such as load balancers, EBS volumes, and other AWS resources that might not be automatically removed when the cluster is deleted. This will help ensure you don't incur unexpected charges.
